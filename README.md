# Nextube

Nextube is a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rotrics/nextube-a-retro-nixie-clock-inspired-modern-display) and [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nextube-retro-nixie-clock-inspired-modern-display) project to make a Nixie tube style clock.

There are some promises from Rotrics (the people behind the hardware) to
release proper development tools, but these are some notes on how the API works
until that is here; for general community information see the [Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/197056519103446). In particular there's
a great "Community User Guide" available there in the Files section that is
_far far better_ than what you will find on the Rotrics site.

[On the wiki](https://github.com/dgl/nextube/wiki) you'll find some unofficial
notes. Using any of this can probably void your warranty, or at least make it
difficult to support you, if you don't understand it, it's probably not worth
trying any of this yet, sorry.*
